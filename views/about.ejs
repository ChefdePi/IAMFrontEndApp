    <h2>About SecureIAM</h2>

    <!-- Elevator pitch -->
    <p>
      SecureIAM is a prototype identity-and-access-management platform purpose-built
      for Australia’s aged-care sector. The goal: give carers, nurses, allied-health
      staff, and administrators the right access at the right time—no more, no less.
    </p>

    <!-- Mission -->
    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      To safeguard elderly residents’ data and simplify compliance for aged-care
      providers by blending cloud-native security patterns with human-centric design.
      In plain English: airtight security that doesn’t slow down care.
    </p>

    <!-- What makes us different -->
    <h3>What Sets SecureIAM Apart</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Role-Based + Attribute-Based Access&nbsp;Control</strong> (RBAC/ABAC) tuned for aged-care workflows.</li>
      <li><strong>Built-in MFA via Azure AD&nbsp;B2C</strong>—no extra apps for staff to juggle.</li>
      <li><strong>Near-real-time Audit Trails</strong> feeding straight into Microsoft Sentinel for threat hunting.</li>
      <li><strong>Least-Privilege Policy Engine</strong> that auto-expires temporary access.</li>
    </ul>
